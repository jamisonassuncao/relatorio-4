abstract = {We present four companion digital models of the age, age uncertainty, spreading rates, and spreading asymmetries of the world's ocean basins as geographic and Mercator grids with 2 arc min resolution. The grids include data from all the major ocean basins as well as detailed reconstructions of back-arc basins. The age, spreading rate, and asymmetry at each grid node are determined by linear interpolation between adjacent seafloor isochrons in the direction of spreading. Ages for ocean floor between the oldest identified magnetic anomalies and continental crust are interpolated by geological estimates of the ages of passive continental margin segments. The age uncertainties for grid cells coinciding with marine magnetic anomaly identifications, observed or rotated to their conjugate ridge flanks, are based on the difference between gridded age and observed age. The uncertainties are also a function of the distance of a given grid cell to the nearest age observation and the proximity to fracture zones or other age discontinuities. Asymmetries in crustal accretion appear to be frequently related to asthenospheric flow from mantle plumes to spreading ridges, resulting in ridge jumps toward hot spots. We also use the new age grid to compute global residual basement depth grids from the difference between observed oceanic basement depth and predicted depth using three alternative age-depth relationships. The new set of grids helps to investigate prominent negative depth anomalies, which may be alternatively related to subducted slab material descending in the mantle or to asthenospheric flow. A combination of our digital grids and the associated relative and absolute plate motion model with seismic tomography and mantle convection model outputs represents a valuable set of tools to investigate geodynamic problems.},

abstract = {Abstract While there has been a lot of work focusing on improving our understanding of divergent and convergent plate boundaries, the intricate nature of back-arc extension, where subduction and large-scale extension occur and interact in close, is yet to be explored properly. It has long been proposed that the strength of the subduction interface, which depends among others on the amount of subducted sediments, plays a pivotal role in subduction dynamics. Here, we investigate the role of back-arc rheology and subduction interface strength on the deformation style of the overriding plate. Using two-dimensional thermomechanical model experiments, we demonstrate, that the presence of a weak mantle–lithospheric domain in the overriding plate can result in back-arc breakup even during the subduction of narrow, land-locked oceanic basins such as those found in the Mediterranean region. The thinning of the back-arc mantle–lithosphere results in a weaker overriding plate, hence a lower slab-pull force is sufficient to initiate back-arc extension. Convective thinning at the subduction interface also reduces the length of the interface, reducing the portion of slab-pull lost as energy dissipation. A weak plate interface, can also reduce the energy dissipated along the subduction zone, leading to earlier extension. A detailed analysis of the forces shaping the overriding plate stress field shows that transmission of slab-pull force has a predominant role while viscous basal drag has a negligible effect in our experiments. Our results compare favorably with large-scale characteristics of land-locked Mediterranean back-arc basins such as the North Tyrrhenian basin and the Pannonian basin.},

The benchmark cases are based on a thermomechanical approach in which the slab is prescribed kinematically and the wedge flow is computed dynamically. We propose various cases to investigate the influence of boundary conditions and rheology on wedge flow and resulting thermal structure. A comparison between the codes suggest that accurate modeling of the thermal field requires a good implementation of the velocity discontinuity along the seismogenic zone and high resolution in the thermal boundary layers. A minor modification to the boundary conditions of the wedge flow is also necessary to avoid a pressure singularity that exists in analytical solutions of the cornerflow model.}

abstract = {AbstractWe present a new whole mantle P wave tomographic model GAP\_P4. We used two data groups; short-period data of more than 10 million picked-up onset times and long-period data of more than 20 thousand differential travel times measured by waveform cross correlation. Finite frequency kernels were calculated at the corresponding frequency bands for both long- and short-period data. With respect to an earlier model GAP\_P2, we find important improvements especially in the transition zone and uppermost lower mantle beneath the South China Sea and the southern Philippine Sea owing to broadband ocean bottom seismometers (BBOBSs) deployed in the western Pacific Ocean where station coverage is poor. This new model is different from a model in which the full data set is interpreted with classical ray theory. BBOBS observations should be more useful to sharpen images of subducted slabs than expected from simple raypath coverage arguments.},

abstract = {AbstractA new P wave tomographic model of the mantle was constructed using more than 10 million travel times. The finite-frequency effect of seismic rays was taken into account by calculating banana-donut kernels at 2 Hz for all first arrival time data, and at 0.1 Hz for broadband differential travel time data. Based on this model, a systematic survey for subducted slab images was developed for the circum-Pacific; including the Kurile, Honshu, Izu-Bonin, Mariana, Java, Tonga-Kermadec, southern and northern South America, and Central America, arcs. This survey revealed a progressive lateral variation of the configuration of slabs along arc(s), which we interpret as an indication for successive stages of slab subduction through the Bullen's transition region with the 660 km discontinuity at the middle. We identified the four distinct stages: I - slab stagnant above the 660 km discontinuity; II - slab penetrating the 660 km discontinuity; III - slab trapped in the uppermost lower mantle (at a depth of 660–1000 km); and IV - slab descending well into the deep lower mantle. The majority of slab images are found to be either at Stage I or III, suggesting that Stages I and III are relatively stable or neutral and II and IV are relatively unstable or transient. There is a remarkable distinction for the deepest hypocentral distribution between slabs at Stage I and slabs at Stages II or III.},

abstract = {We develop a global-scale P wave velocity model (LLNL-G3Dv3) designed to accurately predict seismic travel times at regional and teleseismic distances simultaneously. The model provides a new image of Earth's interior, but the underlying practical purpose of the model is to provide enhanced seismic event location capabilities. The LLNL-G3Dv3 model is based on ∼2.8 millionP and Pnarrivals that are re-processed using our global multiple-event locator called Bayesloc. We construct LLNL-G3Dv3 within a spherical tessellation based framework, allowing for explicit representation of undulating and discontinuous layers including the crust and transition zone layers. Using a multiscale inversion technique, regional trends as well as fine details are captured where the data allow. LLNL-G3Dv3 exhibits large-scale structures including cratons and superplumes as well numerous complex details in the upper mantle including within the transition zone. Particularly, the model reveals new details of a vast network of subducted slabs trapped within the transition beneath much of Eurasia, including beneath the Tibetan Plateau. We demonstrate the impact of Bayesloc multiple-event location on the resulting tomographic images through comparison with images produced without the benefit of multiple-event constraints (single-event locations). We find that the multiple-event locations allow for better reconciliation of the large set of direct P phases recorded at 0–97° distance and yield a smoother and more continuous image relative to the single-event locations. Travel times predicted from a 3-D model are also found to be strongly influenced by the initial locations of the input data, even when an iterative inversion/relocation technique is employed.},

abstract = {Abstract Large numbers of earthquakes occur in subduction zones that are marked by dipping, narrow high seismic velocity slabs. The existence of these fast velocity slabs can cause serious earthquake mislocation problems that can bias estimates of seismic travel time residuals. This can affect the recovery of subducting slabs in tomography as well as introduce significant artifacts into lower mantle structure in tomography models. In order to better account for known subducting slabs, we performed a new P and S wave joint tomography inversion incorporating a three-dimensional thermal model of subducting slabs in the starting model. In addition, velocity and source locations were inverted for simultaneously. Our new P and S models feature higher-amplitude subducting slabs compared with previous global tomography results. The S to P heterogeneity ratio based on the new tomography model indicates that thermal elastic effects alone cannot explain all the heterogeneities in the lower mantle. Much of the observed abnormal S to P heterogeneity ratio can be explained by anelastic effects, the spin transition, and phase transitions of bridgmanite to post-perovskite in the lower mantle.},

abstract = {In contrast to modern-day plate tectonics, studying Precambrian geodynamics presents a unique challenge as currently there is no agreement upon paradigm concerning the global geodynamics and lithosphere tectonics for the early Earth. This review is focused on discussing results of recent modeling studies in the context of existing concepts and constraints for Precambrian geodynamics with an emphasis placed on three critical aspects: (1) subduction and plate tectonics, (2) collision and orogeny, and (3) craton formation and stability. The three key features of Precambrian Earth evolution are outlined based on combining available observations and numerical and analogue models. These are summarized below:•Archean geodynamics was dominated by plume tectonics and the development of hot accretionary orogens with low topography, three-dimensional deformation and pronounced gravitational tectonics. Mantle downwellings and lithospheric delamination (dripping-off) processes are likely to have played a key role in assembling and stabilizing the hot orogens on a timescale up to hundreds of millions of years. Both oceanic-like and continental-like lithospheres were rheologically weak due to the high Moho temperature (>800°C) and melt percolation from hot partially molten sublithospheric mantle.•Wide spread development of modern-style subduction on Earth started during Mesoarchean–Neoarchean at 3.2–2.5Ga. This is marked by the appearance of paired metamorphic complexes and oldest eclogite ages in subcontinental lithospheric mantle. Numerical models suggest that the transition occurred at mantle temperatures 175–250°C higher than present day values, and was triggered by stabilization of rheologically strong plates of both continental and oceanic type. Due to the hot mantle temperature, slab break-off was more frequent in the Precambrian time causing more episodic subduction compared to present day.•Wide spread development of modern-style (cold) collision on Earth started during Neoproterozoic at 600–800Ma and is thus decoupled from the onset of modern-style subduction. Cold collision created favorable conditions for the generation of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic complexes which become widespread in Phanerozoic orogens. Numerical models suggest that the transition occurred at mantle temperatures 80–150°C higher than present day values and was associated with stabilization of the continental subduction. Frequent shallow slab break-off limited occurrence of UHP rocks in the Precambrian time. Further progress in understanding Precambrian geodynamics requires cross-disciplinary efforts with a special emphasis placed upon quantitative testing of existing geodynamic concepts and extrapolating back in geological time, using both global and regional scale thermomechanical numerical models, which have been validated for present day Earth conditions.}
